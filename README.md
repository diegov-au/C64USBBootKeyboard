# C64USBBootKeyboard - BMC64 Compatible
C64 USB Keyboard Arduino Sketch for Pro Micro controllers compatible with BMC64.

This code is based off dabonetn's work here : https://github.com/dabonetn/C64USBKey and features a slight modification to use the hid-project library by NicoHood to add compatibility to BMC64.

The code uses bootkeyboard to provide a bios friendly keyboard.
